Here you will find stuff about Serverless Architecture (how to build, operate and so on) and Kubernetes and Containers for example NSO or Terraform.

Currently the containers are not uploaded to dockerhub (or not publish) but will be linked in the next days.

Also you can find good introduction and more or less the same story at Julio's Blog: https://blogs.cisco.com/author/juliogomez
